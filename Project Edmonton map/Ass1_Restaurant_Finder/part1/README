# Assignment #1: Restaurant Finder part 1
# -----------------------------------------

Included Files :
    * a1part1.cpp
    * lcd_image.cpp
    * lcd_image.h
    * README
    * Makefile

Accessories:
    * Arduino Mega 2560 Board ( AMG )
    * 1 tft display
    * 1 SD card
    * 1 joystick
    * 1 Breadboard

Wiring instructions :
    * Insert the tft display shield with the correct direction
    * Arduino analog pin A8 should connect to joystick VRy
    * Arduino analog pin A9 should connect to joystick VRx
    * Arduino digital pin 53 should connect to joystick pin SW
    * Arduino +5V should connect to joystick +5V
    * Arduino GND should connect to joystick GND

Running Instructions :
    1. Connect the Arduino to the PC using an A - B style USB cable . Ensure
that the Arduino is using the proper serial port (/ dev / ttyACM0 or - ACM1 )
    2. In the directory containing the files , use the command "make upload" to
upload the code to the Arduino.

Makefile Targets :
    * make upload : Builds the project and upload the code to the Arduino.
    * make clean : Removes all object files and executable.
    * make help : Prints a list of targets and the purpose of each.

Contains functions:

    Function main():Call function setup() to initialize the program and continue calling
        function processJoystick() to fulfill the tasks.

    Function setup():Initialize the program, draw the map and initialize the cursor.

    Function redrawCursor(uint16_t colour): forward declaration for redrawing the cursor

    Function redrawMap(int lastLocationX, int lastLocationY): redraw the small portion of
        the map around the old cursor position.

    Function getRestaurantFast(int restIndex, restaurant *restPtr): find the restaurant in terms
        of the index and store it to the pointer *restPtr

    Function get_distance(int x, int y, RestDist *rest_dist): get indices and Manhattan distances
        of all restaurants store them to a pointer which points to rest_dist

    Function swap(RestDist &a, RestDist &b): swap the two structs

    Function isort(RestDist *rest_dist, int n): sort the struct array by each element's distance
        using insertion sort and deal with the joy stick movement

    Function displayText(int index, int selectedRest, RestDist *restDist): display the restaurant
        name highlighted if it is selected

    Function processTouchScreen(int CurrentMapX, int CurrentMapY, RestDist *rest_dist): display
        a small dot in the location of each restaurant in the current view

    Function processMode(int &CurrentMapX, int &CurrentMapY, bool &isMap, RestDist *rest_dist):
            running different modes in terms of the joystick the mode changes when the button
            is pressed
